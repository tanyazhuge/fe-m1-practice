If we have a function defined as function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}, what is the difference between entering sayHello and sayHello() in the console?
sayHello doesn't call the function but print out the code of the function
sayHello() calls the function to program which will print Hello!

What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
parameter is used when declaring a function
argument is used when passing specific value when calling function

What is the keyword return used for?
function is executed and specific value must return

How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
local variables: is only to that specific function
global variables: variable can be used in  the whole script
if you want to use same variable in the one script over and over than you can use global script rather having to declare a local script each time.
